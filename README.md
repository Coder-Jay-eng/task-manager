Task Manager is a collaborative web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for managing tasks in real-time. 
The app will allow users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on tasks, including title, description, due date, and status. 
The application leverages WebSocket (Socket.io) for instant updates and features a responsive React frontend with a secure Node.js and Express.js backend. 
The database will be MongoDB to store task data. 
The project aims to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and the MERN stack, offering a practical example of full-stack development.
