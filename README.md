Task Manager is a collaborative web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for managing tasks in real-time. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on tasks, including title, description, due date, and status. The application leverages WebSocket (Socket.io) for instant updates and features a responsive React frontend with a secure Node.js and Express.js backend. MongoDB stores task data. The project showcases proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and the MERN stack, offering a practical example of full-stack development for potential employers or clients.
